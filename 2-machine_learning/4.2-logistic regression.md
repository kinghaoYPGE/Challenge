### 1.  Logistic Regression

#### Step 1. Data Pre-processing

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as np

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, [2, 3]].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state=0)

# Feature Scaling(因为Age和Salary数值相差太大)
from sklearn.preprocesssing import StandrdScaler
sc = StandrdScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

#### Step 2. Logistic Regression Model

```
# Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Step 3. Prediction

```
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
```

#### Step 4. Evaluating The Predection

confusion matrix is going to contain the correct predictions that our model made on the set as well as the incorrect predictions. 

```
# Making the Confusion Matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
```

#### Step 5. Visualization
